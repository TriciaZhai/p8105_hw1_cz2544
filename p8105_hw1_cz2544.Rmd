# Problem_1 #

##1.1 Create a data frame comprised of:
  A random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution
  A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
  A (length-10) character vector
  A (length-10) factor vector

```{r hw_1_problem_1.1}
library(tidyverse)
hw1_df1 = tibble(
  vec_samp = c(runif(10, min=0, max=5)),
  vec_logi = c(vec_samp > 2),
  vec_char = c(head(month.abb, 10)),
  vec_fact = factor(c("cold", "cold", "cool", "warm", "warm", "hot", "hot", "hot", "cool", "cool"))
)
hw1_df1
```
##1.2 Try to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe

```{r hw_1_problem_1.2}
mean_vec = c(mean(vec_samp), mean(vec_logi), mean(vec_char), mean(vec_fact))
mean_vec
```
Mean value could be achieved for numeric/logical vectors and date, date-time and time interval objects, but not for charactor and factor vectors. For logical vectors, true = 1, and false = 0.

##1.3 Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables
```{r hw_1_problem1.3, results = hide}
as.numeric(vec_logi)
as.numeric(vec_char)
as.numeric(vec_fact)
```

convert your character variable from character to factor to numeric
```{r hw_1_problem1.4}
as.factor(vec_char)
as.numeric(vec_char)
```
When characters are converted to factors, r recognized every different character as a factor level.
Characters cannot be converted to numbers, so 10 "NA"" is the result.

convert your factor variable from factor to character to numeric
```{r hw_1_problem1.5}
as.character(vec_fact)
as.numeric(vec_fact)
```
When factors are converted to charactors, the will be process as words in "", no longer as different levels.
Factor vecters can be converted to numeric vectoers, as r recognize different factor levels of n, numbers from 1 to n has been asigned to different levels of factors. When convert factor vectors to numeric vectors, the asigned numbers for facter will be the new value.

# Problem_2 #

##2.1Create a data frame comprised of:
  x: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution
  y: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution
  A logical vector indicating whether the x + y > 0
  A numeric vector created by coercing the above logical vector
  A factor vector created by coercing the above logical vector

```{r hw_1_problem_2.1}
hw1_df2 = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000),
  y = rnorm(1000),
  xy_logi = c(x + y > 2),
  xy_nume = as.numeric(xy_logi),
  xy_fact = as.factor(xy_logi)
)
hw1_df2
```


{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
